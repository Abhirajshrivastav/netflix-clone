# Netflix Clone Project 🎬 

I’m thrilled to share my latest project: a Netflix clone with login screen, sign in screen and home screen using React.js and CSS. This project was a great opportunity for me to practice my front-end skills and learn how to use React hooks, custom components and API requests. 🚀 I used the TMDB API to fetch the movie data and display it in different categories on the home screen. 🍿

To get the best experience, please view this project on a laptop or desktop as it is not yet mobile-responsive. 🖥️

You can check out the live demo of my project here: https://lnkd.in/gCpTcNfp . 🙌

I have used a dummy sign in screen for this demo, so you don’t need to create an account or enter your personal details. 🔐

I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on how I can improve my code and design. 💬
